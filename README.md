## Crowdsourced search by Location, Time, and Tags

ThereThenThat is like a scrapbook.

ThereThenThat enables searching and creating collections of links to web pages and media.  A search through time, space, and/or keyword can be easily shared in a consistently formatted link.

It has elenents of Imgur, or Flickr, or a Blog...

* Drag and Drop links to web pages...
* Drag and Drop image, audio(mp3), and video(mp4) files into it...
* Paste screen captures...
* instant previews and auto-upload

Users start a collection that expresses some “where, when, what”, and fill it with references and media that relate to that.  Think of something such as:

_"New York City, November 2017, CentralPark, Parade"_

## Build Setup

After cloning the repository, you will see this top level directory structure:
```

ThereThenThat

│   ├── build
│   ├── config
│   ├── src
│   ├── static
│   └── test
├── ThereThenThat-server

You may want to open up two shells - one for server, one for client.
